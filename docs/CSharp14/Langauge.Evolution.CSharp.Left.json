        "year": "2025",
        "article": "Discriminated unions—also known as sum types or tagged unions—are a staple of functional programming languages like F#, Haskell, and Rust. They let you define a type that can be one of many named alternatives, each possibly carrying its own data. This makes modeling domain concepts clearer and safer because the compiler knows all the allowed cases and can enforce exhaustive handling. In C#, developers have long emulated these patterns using inheritance, enums, or records, but native support remains a missing piece."

        "version": "Current Approximations in C#",
        "year": "2025",
        "article": "Since C# does not offer true discriminated unions yet, developers rely on several workarounds. The `OneOf<T1, T2,…>` library provides a generic union type with exhaustive `Match(...)` and `Switch(...)` methods, offering compile-time safety :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. Other patterns include sealed class hierarchies with pattern matching, or using Azure Durable Functions' state machine constructs to simulate union behavior. While functional, these approaches are often verbose, scatter logic, or lack built-in exhaustiveness guarantees."

      {
        "version": "State of Proposals and Design",
        "year": "2025",
        "article": "There is an active proposal on the official C# GitHub repository for `union` or “type union” syntax, aiming to simplify defining closed alternative types with built-in compiler checks :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. The initial designs use a `union` keyword and generate closed hierarchies via generated attributes. Despite interest, no preview of this feature made it into C# 14 (.NET 10), and the language design team continues to assess complexity, syntax consistency, and runtime integration :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}."

      {
        "version": "Benefits of Native Support",
        "year": "2025",
        "article": "Adding discriminated unions to C# would significantly enhance domain modeling. You could define APIs or state machines with explicit, exhaustive alternatives, making code safer and easier to maintain. For example, rather than return an `object` or throw exceptions, a method could return a union like `Result.Success` or `Result.Error`, with the compiler ensuring all cases are handled at compile time. This pattern reduces runtime surprises and enhances readability across large codebases."

      {
        "version": "Design Challenges",
        "year": "2025",
        "article": "Bringing discriminated unions to C# isn’t trivial. The language team must design a syntax that meshes well with records, enums, and classes, while preserving backward compatibility. Runtime serialization, reflection, and interoperability with tooling like debuggers must also be considered. Performance is another concern—some approaches may require boxing, runtime tags, or complex code generation :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}."

      {
        "version": "Use Cases",
        "year": "2025",
        "article": "Native discriminated unions would benefit areas like API result handling, command processing, and domain-driven design. For example, HTTP endpoints could directly return unions like `Ok<T>`, `NotFound`, or `Error`, improving clarity. Workflow definitions, state machines, parsers, and configuration schemas are other strong candidates where exhaustive union types would reduce edge-case bugs and increase declarative expressiveness."

      {
        "version": "Probability Outlook",
        "year": "2025",
        "article": "The likelihood of discriminated unions landing in C# 14 (expected with .NET 10 in late 2025) remains low—estimated at around 10–20%. Developers have long pushed for them, and prototypes exist, but language design cycles are careful and deliberate. For C# 15 or later, odds rise significantly—perhaps 40–50%—as foundational pieces like pattern matching and records mature, making union integration more feasible."
      },
      {
        "version": "Approval Process",
        "year": "2025",
        "article": "Any new C# language feature passes through a formal process: proposals go to the `dotnet/csharplang` GitHub repo, where they’re discussed by both the public and the language design team. Key stakeholders—including Mads Torgersen and core language designers—debate feasibility in regular LDMs (Language Design Meetings). Only after consensus does a feature move into prototype, preview, and eventually full implementation, aligned with .NET release planning."
      },
      {
        "version": "Conclusion",
        "year": "2025",
        "article": "Discriminated unions represent a highly beneficial evolution for C#, bringing strong typing, developer clarity, and safer patterns in line with functional language strengths. Although unlikely to appear in C# 14, active interest, ongoing proposals, and growing compounding pressure make true union types a credible future addition. The next few versions of C# are where momentum may finally meet delivery."
